Hello! On internet, I'm known as Burek, or BurekOne. I'm just an everyday Joe, hailing from Europe. My interests are Linux(I do also use Windows), electricity, indie culture, music, tinkering with software, and one day with hardware too, as well as electronics. This is my _nth_ time trying to making a blog. I was probably way too lazy to maintain it in the past, sometimes I didn't have anything to write about, so I kinda abandoned the thought. Hopefully that will change since I'm being interested in a few new things, so I might as well keep "journal" about those things, and maybe reflect upon them in the future. Blog made with Jekyll with some slight modifications by myself. Thanks for reading!
